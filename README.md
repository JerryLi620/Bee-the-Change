# Bee-the-Change
Bee the Change is a turn-based government simulator game in which you are a bee politician trying to be reelected during the environmental collapse of the world. During each round, there are two phases. First, you must choose between a set of policies to respond to natural disasters. Second, you choose which honeycombs to build in. The game ends after 10 turns when the election occurs. You win if you are reelected, you lose if you are not. <br />

Overview of Game and Game Mechanics:<br />
The game revolves around a hive of bees. As their elected leader, you must respond to emergencies to the hive and choose where and what to build. Many of the events that you must respond to are global warming related. Over the span of 15 turns the player will improve their popularity with the colony by improving the hive's core traits, passing policies, and responding well to adverse events. <br />

There are 5 traits associated with the hive that, depending on the player’s actions, can go up or down. These traits are: Honey Production (HP), Bee Rights (BR), Flower Density (FD), Life Expectancy (LE), and Happiness (H). Each honeycomb in the hive will care solely about three of these traits. The three traits each comb cares about are ranked in order of importance to the bees that live there. These traits directly determine your popularity in that honeycomb. Gameplay is divided into two phases:<br />

Phase 1: Event<br />
At the beginning of each round, an event will occur causing the player to choose between two options of how to respond. For example, one event called, “The hottest day yet” would have the description: “The human’s monsters of metal have choked our forest in heat. Today the sun beats down with a dangerous intensity” Then you would choose between giving the worker bees the day off (HP↓)(BR↑)(LE↑), and making them work anyway (LE↓)(HP↑)(FD↑). <br />

Phase 2: Build <br />
In this phase, you will have the opportunity to build or upgrade a structure in any honeycomb. This structure will affect the one hive trait for the comb it is built in and all adjacent combs. The following buildings are available:<br />
Honey Collector (HP↑)
Break Room(BR↑)
Pollination Station(FD↑)
Bee Hospital(LE↑)
Dance Club(H↑)
